Hi , Kirss,
This is Datong Zhou 5795. My idea of the project will be a mobile platform for building relationship between Customers and Shops. This app have two target users. One is for the shop owner the other one is for their customers. The application for shop owner will allow shop to set products that customer can view online, post news, sent voucher and manage customers. The one for customer will allow user to discover the shop near by , get membership card, online order, online booking and view shop products. This Application is not only for restaurants. It can work with any kind of shops whatever they provide what kind of services or products. I will build a platform that shop owner can easy build their online shop without any IT knowledge and easy to manage that shop. This application can reduce the waiting time of restaurant, reduce the queue and change people shopping style.
